RebYell5,Almost unusable now,1,2025-08-17T13:41:22Z,20.32.5,False,0,"Remember when Youtube was good?  Now it's commercials every 3 minutes, a search feature that gives you everything but what you searched for, ads that pop up just because you paused the video for even 1/10 of a second, the same video recommendations over and over, and Google stealing your personal information.  Everything is run by ""the algorithm"" which has nothing to do with being helpful and everything to do with showing you more ads and channels Youtube wants you to see.  Unfortunately, there's not a real viable alternative that's yet really picked up steam.  I'll give Youtube some praise for still having a relatively good interface, but mostly it just feels like a platform to show ads and take personal information now.

And now they want even more personal information, to restrict access to accounts and require people to give their government-issued ID to prove they're adults to protect ""the kids.""  This is basically why Google exists now:  to take your information.",,us

Slumbertime101,Great with a caveat,4,2025-08-17T11:19:14Z,20.32.5,False,0,"YouTube has an endless amount of amazing content on it and probably because it's a Google product, the search and discovery are very effective. The only complaint I really have is that you can't listen to a YouTube video in the background on an iOS device unless you pay for some type of premium account. I think that's really shortsighted on the part of Google, because they make a lot of money from the ads that they insert into videos. It would be good for both the audience and the creators if they changed this policy. I certainly don't think restricting this feature causes anybody to pay for a premium subscription.",,us
Super Mario breh,Could be really awesome,3,2025-08-17T11:16:59Z,20.32.5,False,0,"There’s a lot of great content on YouTube, but recently the algorithm has been pushing mostly things that I don’t want to watch to my fyp. I’ve tried to fix it by clearing my history and watching videos from the search bar related to my interests, but my fyp is still littered with random clickbait videos that I don’t want to see. I hope this gets fixed because I like content on YouTube, but what I want to watch won’t find me.",,us
