This media attempt needs to be destroyed. Any liberal democrat should be banned from spewing lies 
Trump or a maga supporting individual is scrutinized for every thing they say and do. Freedom of speech was not meant to for the ugly lies coming from their months. To see Facebook being allowed to spew hate is a travesty.

Oh and the scammers are a nightmare to boot. I’ve noticed that a lot of new changes have been made to the style of Facebook and the way we comment. The new style will take some time getting used too, but overall it isn’t bad. Thanks for building this app. Just limit scammers please.",,us

Sherilee123,Why I like Facebook,5,2025-08-17T09:04:30Z,526.0.0,False,0,"Facebook has given me the opportunity to connect to the joys and sadness of friends and family. I have a physical condition that keeps me at home most of the time. Facebook has given me the opportunity to connect in ways that I would not be able to. I also enjoy connecting with people that I do not know who have the same interest that I do. I love seeing other people’s artwork, sewing, creativity of all kinds. I love reading stories, especially those heartwarming stories that so often come across
In the Facebook feed. I’m able to share pictures of my grandchildren as they grow with people that I have known since  I was a teenager. I grew up on an island where most people knew each other, and we have stayed in touch through Facebook. I’ve watched their children and their grandchildren. I’ve listened to their sorrows as they have lost loved ones and tried to comfort them as they have tried to comfort me many times. I think Facebook, though criticized by many, is a great outlet for joy, communication and information! 💛🧡💚",,us
