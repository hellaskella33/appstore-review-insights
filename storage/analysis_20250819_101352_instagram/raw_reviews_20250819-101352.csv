manidajon,Music Options,1,2025-08-17T15:25:05Z,393.1.0,False,0,"Instagram‚Äôs song library has to be one of the most frustrating parts of the app. For a platform that thrives on trends, reels, and creative expression, you‚Äôd think they would have the most up-to-date music catalog. Instead, it feels like we‚Äôre stuck with scraps.

Half the time, the actual trending songs that are blowing up on TikTok or Spotify aren‚Äôt even available. And when they are there, they‚Äôre often random remixes, sped-up/slow-down versions, or some bootleg copy instead of the real track. It completely kills the vibe when you‚Äôre trying to make a reel that matches a popular trend but Instagram just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt have the song.

What makes it worse is how inconsistent it is. Some creators have access to certain songs, while others don‚Äôt because of region or account type. Meanwhile, Instagram keeps pushing reels as their main feature, but how are we supposed to compete or keep up with trends if we don‚Äôt even have the right tools?

At this point, Instagram‚Äôs music library feels like a watered-down version of what social media should be offering. Until they fix licensing, update their catalog regularly, and actually give users access to the same trending music that everyone else is using, the song selection is nothing short of horrible.

Gogettax3,My experience with instagram recenlty,3,2025-08-17T10:13:21Z,393.1.0,False,0,"Instagram should take more care in how it handles account bans, because banning people without a clear reason or explanation is unfair and discouraging to its users. Many people put time, effort, and creativity into building their profiles, only to have their accounts suddenly disabled without warning or proper justification. Mistaken bans hurt real people and damage trust in the platform. Instead of unfairly removing accounts, Instagram should improve its review process, provide clear communication, and give users a fair chance to appeal.",,us
olivecw,Ban,1,2025-08-17T10:08:00Z,393.1.0,False,0,"My friends and I were recently banned from Instagram without any explanation, despite the fact that we have always followed the Community Guidelines and Terms of Use. None of us posted harmful content, engaged in harassment, or violated the rules in any way. We primarily use Instagram to stay connected with our friends and share everyday moments, so it was very surprising and frustrating to suddenly lose access to our accounts without warning. We believe this may have been a mistake or an automated error, and we respectfully request a thorough review of our accounts so that we can be reinstated as soon as possible. We never posted anything offensive, hateful, or inappropriate, and we always used Instagram responsibly just to connect with friends and share positive content. Out of nowhere, our accounts were disabled without warning, and we weren‚Äôt even told what the reason was. This feels extremely unfair and frustrating, because Instagram is one of the main ways we stay in touch with people. We truly believe this was a mistake, and we want our accounts to be restored so we can get back to using Instagram in the way it‚Äôs meant to be used",,us
