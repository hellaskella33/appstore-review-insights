Instead, it feels like we’re stuck with scraps.

Half the time, the actual trending songs that are blowing up on TikTok or Spotify aren’t even available. And when they are there, they’re often random remixes, sped-up/slow-down versions, or some bootleg copy instead of the real track. It completely kills the vibe when you’re trying to make a reel that matches a popular trend but Instagram just… doesn’t have the song.

What makes it worse is how inconsistent it is. Some creators have access to certain songs, while others don’t because of region or account type. Meanwhile, Instagram keeps pushing reels as their main feature, but how are we supposed to compete or keep up with trends if we don’t even have the right tools?

At this point, Instagram’s music library feels like a watered-down version of what social media should be offering. Until they fix licensing, update their catalog regularly, and actually give users access to the same trending music that everyone else is using, the song selection is nothing short of horrible.
